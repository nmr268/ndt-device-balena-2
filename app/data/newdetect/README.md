# ndt-newdetect
This is the home of newdetect. Only make changes here as it is used in other scripts 

newdetect was originally an entire program suite, designed to do all processing of samples, and make a prediction.

As of now (release 0.1), new detect is only used to make the cutout of the smaller squares.

New detect is used like this: `python2 newdetect.py training <raw_image>`
